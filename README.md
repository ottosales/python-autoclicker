# python-autoclicker
a quick autoclicker script made with python

I actually made this because I was playing Terraria and my weapon attacks needed clicks constantly, so to preserve both my finger and my mouse's health, I did this script to help me out

double click it to run. needs python installed, if you don't know how to install it, just use the windows store (⊃｡•́‿•̀｡)⊃

you can turn it on / off with the key `'`<br>
you can close the script with the key `r` <br>
it clicks every `20ms` if I remember correctly

if you open the script, you can change these parameters (variables `delay`, `start_stop_key` and `exit_key`)
